# 68K-study
Following the study as a software engineer to go beyond the scope of our lecture I tried to implement a little game on an old motorola processor. this as all been done using a simulator for the motorola and only interrupt of I/O the code is still in it's embryo stage, you will find it under the name game, all the other file are little excercise that might be helpful to someone who as, or will be studying assembly 68k. all the code has been proved functioning in EASY68K software at least at the time of publishment, keep in mind that due to the fact that assembly interrupt depends on the system used, if you use a different IDE or compiler you might get errors or syntax differences.
In this project I used two different type of syntax both supported by easy68k simulator, the native and the original motorola syntax.
